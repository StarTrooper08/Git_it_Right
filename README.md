# Git it Right
**`Git commands cheatsheetüìÅ`**

## The Essentials ‚Äî When working with git on your own or with others

* `git status` - To remind you of where you left off. See a summary of local changes, remote commits, and untracked files.
* `git diff` - To see the specific local changes to tracked files. Use --name-only to see changed filenames.
* `git add` - To stage changes to your tracked and untracked files. Use -u, -a, and . strategically.
* `git commit` - To create a new commit with changes previously added. Use -m and add a meaningful commit message.
* `git push` - To send changes to your configured remoterepository, most commonly GitLab or GitHub.


## **Basic Flow ‚Äî Daily usage of git, including flags**

1. **cd to your local project that you want to start versioning with git. You only have to run git init the first time to set up the directory for version tracking.** 

```
git init 
git status 
git add --all 
git status 
git commit -m "meaningful initial commit message"
git show 
```


2. **And you begin to hack on your local files, then commit at regular intervals.**

```
git diff 
git commit -a -m "Another commit message. -a performs the add step for you"
git status 
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
```
3. **After a while, you have 3 commits that would be more meaningful as a single commit**

```git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
git reset --soft HEAD~3 
git diff --cached 
git commit -a -m "Better commit 
message for last 3 commits" 
```
4. **Lastly, you delete some unneeded files in the current directory**

```
git status 
git diff --cached 
git add -u 
git commit -m "Another commit message. -u adds updates, including deleted files"
git status 
git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit
git push origin master
```

## Basic Branching ‚Äî Branches represent a series of commits.

* `git branch --all` - list all local and remote branches
* `git checkout <branch>` - change to an existing branch
* `git checkout -b <branch> master` - make a branch based off of masterand check it out
* `git checkout master && git merge <branch>` - merge branch changes onto master

## Important Flags ‚Äî These are my personal favorites for keeping everything organized.

* `git reset HEAD --` - get back to the last known commit and unstage others
* `git add -u` - add only the updated, previously committed files
* `git log --graph --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit` - for a pretty branch history. Create a shell or git alias for easy access,such as git lg

## Working with a Remote Repository ‚Äî Once you get into the flow, you‚Äôll frequently contribute back to larger projects, and possibly managing forks of forks. Here are some tips for doing so.

* `git fetch --all` - downloads all commits, files, and references to branches on all remote repositories so you can then git checkout or pull what you want to work on.
* `git pull --rebase <remote> <branch>` - Merge all commits since your last common commit from the remote branch without creating a merge commit.
* `git stash` - Use this as needed to save uncommitted changes so you can git stash pop them onto a different branch.
* `git stash pop` - bring it back
* `git add [-A or . or -- <filename>]` - Be intentional about what files you add to your commits, especially if you want to open a request to merge them into an upstream project.
* `git commit -m "commit message" ` - Most projects have a format they prefer for commit messages. Look at CONTRIBUTING.md files in the project or review previous commits to get an idea of their format.
* `git push origin <branch>` - Push your current branch to your remote titled ‚Äúorigin‚Äù and branch named <branch>
* `git checkout -b <new_branch>` - A shortcut for git branch <branch> && git checkout branch. It‚Äôs great for when you want to experiment with an idea and have a new branch to try it out on that can later be merged or deleted.
* `git checkout master && git pull --rebase` - Great to get to the most recent commit for a project you only infrequently follow.
* `git reset --hard origin/master` - For when you inevitably get lost in all the 
git-fu and need to get to a known state. 
WARNING: this erases all changes, even 
commits, since the last commit pushed to 
the remote origin on branch master.
* `git push origin master` - For when you inevitably do something right! Send your changes up to your remote titled origin on branch master.


## Getting Help
* `git <cmd> -h` - great for quick review of command flags
* `git <cmd> --help` - to dig into the full man pages of the command
